Timekeeper helps Java/Groovy test codes to record performance measurement statistics, and to compile reports in Markdown format.

== Motivation

Often I develop Web UI tests in Groovy using Selenium. I wanted to measure the performance of the tests. Often I want to measure:

1. how long (seconds) tests take to navigate to a URL in browser
2. how long tests take to take and save screenshot of a web page
3. how large (bytes) is the generated image file

I want to examine many URLs; 100 or more. In practice, most of URLs respond within 3 seconds but a few of them sometimes respond slow (over 20 seconds). Why? What happened? I need to list the slow URLs and look into them.

The 1st problem is that it is bothersome recording the duration with a stopwatch. So I introduced the Apache Commonns https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/StopWatch.html[StopWatch] library to measure the duration and print the figure in console messages. Still, it is difficult to find useful information out of bulky console messages. So I want to summerise the staticstics. The 2nd problem is that it is too tiresome to write a statistics report in Markdown table format manually. I want to automate this task. I want my WebUI tests to perform performance measurement and reporting as well. Here comes the Timekeeper!

== API

Javadoc is link:./api/index.html[here]

== Examples

A `Timekeeper` object lets you create **one or more** `Measurement` objects. A `Measurement` object stands for a table which contains a header and one or more `Record` set. A `Record` contains columns and a duration in `mm:ss` format (minutes:seconds). My test will put an instance of `LocalDateTime.now()` just before the test calls a long running method call (such as Selenium navite, and taking screenshot). This timestatmp is recorded as `startAt`. Also my test will put another instance of `LocalDateTime.now()` just after the long-running method call. This timestamp is recorded `endAt`. Each record object can calculate the duration = endAt minus startAt. And finally Timekeeper's `report(Path)` method can generate a text report in Markdown syntax.


=== Example 1 --- minimalistic

The following example is a minimalistic example of utilizing the Timekeeper library, in Groovy using JUnit 5.

[code]
----
include::../src/test/groovy/com/kazurayam/timekeeper/demo/TimeKeeperDemoMinimal.groovy[]
----

This code outputs the following markdown text.

[code]
----
## How long it waited

|description m1|duration|graph|
|:----|----:|:----|
|sleeping for 2 secs|00:02|`#`|
|sleeping for 3 secs|00:03|`#`|
|sleeping for 5 secs|00:05|`#`|
|sleeping for 7 secs|00:07|`#`|
|Average|00:04|

The format of duration is "minutes:seconds"

one # represents 10 seconds in the duration graph
----

=== Example 2 ---

The following code processes a list URLs. It makes HTTP GET request, save the request body into file. It checks the size of the file in bytes, and measures the duration of HTTP GET request.

[code]
----
include::../src/test/groovy/com/kazurayam/timekeeper/demo/TimekeeperDemoHttpInteraction.groovy[]
----

This code will output the following markdown text.

[code]
----
## get URL, save HTML into file

|URL|size|duration|graph|
|:----|----:|----:|:----|
|https://www.google.com/search?q=timekeeper|7,153|00:01|`#`|
|https://duckduckgo.com/?q=timekeeper&t=h_&ia=web|156|00:00|`#`|
|https://search.yahoo.co.jp/search?p=timekeeper|20,927|00:01|`#`|
|Average|9,412|00:01|
----

=== Example 3 --- Selenium test

Input CSV file is here:

----
include::../src/test/fixtures/URLs.csv[]
----

The test emits the following Markdown text:

[code]
----
## How long it took to navigate to URLs

|URL|duration|graph|
|:----|----:|:----|
|https://www.google.com/search?q=timekeeper|00:02|`#`|
|https://duckduckgo.com/?q=timekeeper&t=h_&ia=web|00:02|`#`|
|https://search.yahoo.co.jp/search?p=timekeeper|00:03|`#`|
|Average|00:02|

The format of duration is "minutes:seconds"

one # represents 10 seconds in the duration graph

## How long it took to take shootshots

|URL|size|duration|graph|
|:----|----:|----:|:----|
|https://www.google.com/search?q=timekeeper|510,456|00:05|`#`|
|https://duckduckgo.com/?q=timekeeper&t=h_&ia=web|272,954|00:03|`#`|
|https://search.yahoo.co.jp/search?p=timekeeper|381,088|00:03|`#`|
|Average|388,166|00:04|
----

This Markdown text will be rendered on browser like this:
